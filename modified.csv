518,0, The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w delays on UA     would have to be taken up online...
519,0, But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
520,1,   We'll see what we can do.  KN  We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
521,0, yes  but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for   days! Unacceptable!!

545,0, Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.

558,0, for an early flt  I think a call is appropriate. Yes  reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
559,0, again I ask  who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
560,0, Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over   hours at  ... Going to miss my ride at  help please! HelpImStuck United
561,0, it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by    seats  amp feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement

574,0, Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry on was apparently taken off  amp  left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
575,0, Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.

577,0, Delay DEN CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this  ker. friendlyskies??

606,0, what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA      from Denver to Vegas?
607,0, UA   from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by   UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.

762,0,    min more delays to flt      at sfo   load   more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns

768,0, well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
769,0, it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket   rude agents angry face with horns

855,0, shes been rescheduled for today  but with the frigid cold  being a possible reason for  maintenance  it could be the same issue  day

1649,0, I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers  I have plans and no answers....

3306,0, They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.

4479,0, Longer flights with     series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
4480,0, excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm  rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?

4482,0, the sign in screen had major mobile issues  the responsive design wasn't working properly my Nexus  .
4483,0, sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?

4494,0, is this account even aware of the destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
4495,1, Thank you! I can't wait either

5477,1, Thanks JB. Actually  As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them.

5577,0, thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed   days getting back
5578,0, yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
5579,0, WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
5580,0, If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.

8403,0, now siting on Tarmac in philly for another    minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
8404,0, what is the damn delay????
8405,0, it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
8406,0, app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
8407,0, has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
8408,0, And also  it's great that you tweet   complainers  but what about the in person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch   useless.

8410,0, thanks for making miss connection  getting rebooked  missing that too  and a miserable day. Started my day       am for nothing!
8411,0, need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at gsp  and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight       hours!
8412,0, that the flight was delayed  amp  closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad  bad service

8414,0, He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. Grossedout
8415,1, I appreciate your prompt response.
8416,0, nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
8417,0, well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
8418,0, I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
8419,0, doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help usairwaysfail
8420,0, this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
8421,0, we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
8422,0, the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
8423,0, nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
8424,0, is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
8425,1, Thks US           PHL to FLL. Overall  st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
8426,0, I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
8427,0, this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air

8433,0, we got   drink then F A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service   First class.
8434,0, Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat  too. oldseatnocushion worstflight nohelponboard
8435,0, First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging  st drink service    min after take off

8440,0, is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.

8448,0, NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http   t.co  dDQq gQni
8449,0,. I rebooked myself   but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at     pm.
8450,0,    hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for     years  but no more!
8451,0, this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
8452,0, been at DCA at   pm still here at   am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
8453,0, it was       almost   hours Late Flight due to mechanical.
8454,0, never flying USAirways again. Horrible experience  terrible customer service.
8455,1, we will...sunday! Just a few days away
8456,0, unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
8457,0, I have been on three planes for flight      and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE sad
8458,0, Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
8459,0, Why were we loaded onto the plane    hours Late Flight  mind you   made to sit for    minutes
8460,0, why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
8461,0, offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
8462,1,   We're excited to have you fly with us  JB! When will this be?  Spring Break !!!
8463,0, that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. FAA
8464,1, I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back   better than most. OK hand
8465,0, that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
8466,0, that's incorrect. Four people  last flight of the night  with our bags. horriblecustomerservice
8467,1, Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
8468,0, the fact that you are making customers pay     to  choose  a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
8469,0, I ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than  
8470,0, your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. shameonyou usairwayssucks
8471,0, worst experience ever with you guys see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
8472,0, now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
8473,0, please explain  I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!
8474,0, I doubt that  its      p  amp  we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice.
8475,0, why does it cost      to change a      ticket when it only cost      to purchase a new ticket?
8476,0,     . Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
8477,0, we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
8478,0, doesn't want me to get home
8479,0, They don't stand alone for me  I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
8480,0, DCA  gt HPN  u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus   plane for    min now sitting on plane with no mvmt  amp    announcement    gt  hour!
8481,0,   I bet you don't  but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays  thank you.
8482,0, I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive  forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
8483,0, oh great after a   hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving. Flight      has been awful
8484,0, that's the  st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
8485,0, never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
8486,0, my buddies are currently delayed  .  hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week  any compensation? FlyDelta

8493,0, sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane     minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
8494,0, you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
8495,0, the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
8496,0,  st a Late Flight plane  then missing flight crew  then maintenance problems  gates switched   times. You call this customer service??
8497,0, due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines  we chose yours  all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!
8498,0, we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home  turns out we can't afford to go home.
8499,0, ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight  and now we are stranded.
